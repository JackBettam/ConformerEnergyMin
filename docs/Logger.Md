# Logger.py

This is a custom built logging package. The aim is to export a message to the log after a successful (or failed) step has occured. 

The default log is 'log.txt', but this can be changed by specifying a name of the desired file. This will need to be called everytime. This is useful if you want to have different logs for different parts of the script. 
If the file doesn't exist, then it will be created.
