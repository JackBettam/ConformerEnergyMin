# ImportExport.py
This local package is used to import molecules and export files. It moves a lot of logic from the main script to this package to make the main script easier to understand. 

This package also uses the local [Logger](/docs/Logger.Md) package which records errors and unespected codes, as well as repeats what is defined by the user.
